# Galeria: An Image Gallery Page Using React



## Description

Galeria is an image gallery that utilizes CRUD capabilities in order to allow the user to upload, delete and 'like' images.

---

**This project primarily utilizes the following technologies:**
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Node.js
- React
- Postico /Postgres SQL
- Material UI for React

**Workflow:**
- A user has the ability to upload an image at the top of the page. This opens a modal form where the user can enter an image url and a description.
- Once a user selects 'upload' the new image will be visible among the gallery- displayed as a card.
- Each card has a counter to keep track of how many times it has been liked.
- Each card also has two buttons. The 'Like' button will increase the like count on the card, while the 'Delete' button will remove the card from the page.
- Each image can also be clicked directly to provide the original uploaders description.
- The image path, description and likes are all stored on a database with a unique id.
